## Q: How `Redux` works?
A: When we perform any event in UI, it dispatches an action, that will call reducer function and reducer function updates the slice and because the UI component subscribed to store using selector, it will automatically updates the value.

# Redux Toolkit
 - Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
 - Build our store
 - Connect our store to App
 - Slice (eg. cartSlice)
 - dispatch(action)
 - selector
